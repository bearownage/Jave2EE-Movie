# Jave2EE-Movie

One of many attempts to create a movie application while learning java enterprise edition.

Fairly easy to run.

Install Tomcat 8.5 on eclipse

Run on server

Will be viewable on localhost:8090/cart

# OR

In the root directory, run the below command if you have gradle installed on your system.

```
./gradlew appRun
```

The application will then be run on localhost:8080
